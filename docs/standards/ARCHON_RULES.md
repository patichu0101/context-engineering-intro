# 🗭 CRITICAL: ARCHON-FIRST RULE

Before any task-related action:

1. **Check if Archon MCP is available**
2. Use **Archon** as the **primary system** for:
   - Task management
   - Research
   - Project organization
3. Use **TodoWrite** only for secondary/personal notes
4. This overrides all PRPs, system patterns, and legacy flows

## 🚨 Violation Check

If you initiated any task flow with TodoWrite, STOP and restart using Archon:

```bash
archon:manage_task(action="get", task_id="...")
```
